 crisis_energy_crisis_description_intro: "Galactic civilizations have long foreseen an ultimate catastrophe—a fate from which there is no escape, a §Rcataclysm§! that tears through space and time. Some prophets have imagined that this disaster would manifest in unimaginable ways, beyond the understanding and control of all civilizations. Yet, the true danger does not come from an external force, but from §Rourselves§!, from those who seek to control the very essence of the universe.\nThe ancient empires resting within the stars possess the power we seek, but they have been blinded by their own grandeur, losing their ambition and vigilance. Now, with our mastery over §GCatastrophic Energy§!, we are prepared to surpass their achievements and become the ultimate force in this galaxy.\n§GCatastrophic Energy§! transcends known cosmic laws. It warps reality, devours time, and grants us unprecedented destructive and creative powers. We no longer need to wait for an external calamity, for §Rwe§! are the true catastrophe, destined to reduce all to nothing and rebuild a new order in the universe."
 crisis_energy_crisis_description: "$menace_crisis_description_intro$\n\nWe are no longer citizens of the galaxy, but its rulers. Any star systems or civilizations that stand in our way will be reduced to dust by our will."
