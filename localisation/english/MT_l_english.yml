 mt_planet_event.11.desc:0 "The third plan has been successfully completed, and [Root.GetName] has increased the usable area. \n\nAlthough we had previously modified the ocean during the advanced Gaia plan, it only remained on the surface and did not fully utilize the underwater resources. The third plan built a city circle under the sea. This not only expands our activity range but also helps us to further research the ocean."

 mt_planet_event.12.desc:0 "Since the implementation of the third plan, numerous professionals and tourists have settled in the underwater cities, which were initially used for research and tourism only. \n\nHowever, with the deepening exploration of the sea, we have discovered treasures hidden in the ocean, such as a kind of pearl that almost everyone covets and a nutrient-rich seaweed. \n\nUnfortunately, if we collect too many pearls, the growth of seaweed will be destroyed, and vice versa, so we can only choose one."

After leaving the urban areas, they will find that every part of this planet is suitable for settlement, and there will no longer be a distinction between urban areas and wasteland."

 mt_planet_event.14.desc:0 "Since Plan No. 4 was implemented, more and more people have been willing to leave the city and explore the depths of the planet, which has effectively expanded our activity space. \n\nHowever, we soon discovered a problem:There were quite a few people who voluntarily abandoned modern technology and lived a primitive life in the wilderness of the planet! We were very surprised by this behavior, which seems to be spreading. More and more "primitive tribes" have appeared on the entire planet. \n\nThe research team believes that the loss of population will not affect the development of the planet, and their behavior seems to have certain benefits for the primitive areas we have delineated. However, experts still recommend managing them to a certain extent."

Researchers have told us that this evolution is limited, and these plants will never have real intelligence, but they will have a huge impact on our entire planet."
